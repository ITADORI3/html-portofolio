<h3>One Piece: Stampede</h3>
<p>
    The Straw Hat Pirates arrive at Delta Island for the Pirate Fest, a large pirate gathering organized by Buena Festa. Festa sends the pirates to a floating island to hunt for a treasure that belonged to the Pirate King, Gol D. Roger.
    The Straw Hats and many other pirate crews, including those from the Worst Generation as well as other past allies and enemies, set sail on a Knock Up Stream and battle each other as they race towards the treasure.
    However, this event is secretly set up as part of a plan between Festa and legendary pirate Douglas Bullet, who had been in the great prison Impel Down for two decades until being freed two years ago. Trafalgar Law discovers this and is attacked, but escapes onto the Thousand Sunny and warns the Straw Hats.
<br/>
Robin, Sanji, Chopper and Brook go with him to investigate, followed by the undercover Smoker. After sneaking into Festa's hideout, they discover that he has conspired with the Marines to send a Buster Call on Delta Island, 
which would destroy it and everyone on it. As the treasure is found, a ship arrives and destroys the floating island. The pirates fall into the bay below, where Bullet takes the treasure and challenges the members of the Worst Generation to a fight. 
Luffy and the other Worst Generation members are quickly overwhelmed by his strength and Clank-Clank Fruit powers. He attempts to kill Luffy, but Usopp distracts him, causing Bullet to attack him instead while the other pirates attempt to flee from Delta Island, 
but find the Marine Buster Call fleet headed toward them. As the pirates fight the Marines, Law's group encounters Smoker in Festa's lair, and Sanji battles him while Law and Robin escape.
